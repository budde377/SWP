Database setup for MySQL in JWIG:

First you must install MySQL on your system using the Windows installer or apt-get or 
another installer of your choice. This is specific to your distribution so please see 
the documentation provided for your system.

Second we want to create a database. On Linux or OS X log in as root.
If the database has never been used before you will need to set up a few things 
(on Windows the installer wizard will guide you through this, in Linux/OS X you are 
on your own).
You must setup a password for MySQL. Do this by typing
 
  mysqladmin -u root password "mypassword"
   
where mypassword is a password of your choice, but do not use your normal root 
password ;-).
Start the mysql command line utility as MySQL root user:
 
  mysql -u root -p

and type your password when prompted.
Create a new database (let us call it jwig):

  create database jwig;

If you use the standard JWIG database setup you will not have to create any tables. 
This will be done by Hibernate. The Hibernate setup is located in jwig.properties
or in the hibernate.hbm.xml file in the kickstart folder. All you have to do is to 
set the 'hibernate.connection.url' property to the URL of you database 
(typically jdbc:mysql://localhost/jwig if the server runs on the same machine as 
JWIG and the data you created is named 'jwig'), the property 
'hibernate.connection.username' to 'root' and 'hibernate.connection.password' to the 
password you picked.
If you use something else than MySQL please resort to the Hibernate documentation 
for setup instructions. You will have to use a different URL and a different 
driver_class in this case. Anything else in JWIG is not MySQL specific.

Now to tell JWIG that you have set up database access by setting the configuration
property 'jwig.hibernate'. This should be done in jwig.properties using

  jwig.hibernate = true

or in the constructor of your web site class:

  setProperty("hibernate", true);
