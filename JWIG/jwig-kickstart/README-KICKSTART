This package contains a simple JWIG application and relevant files to 
get you started with JWIG.

First, follow the instructions in the file INSTALL for installing 
the necessary programs.
The file INSTALL-PROXY contains instructions for setting up a local  
Apache httpd proxy server in front of Tomcat. 
The file INSTALL-DATABASE describes database setup using MySQL.

Rename the file local.properties.example to local.properties and 
edit it to set the 'webapps' property to the location of the web 
application directory of your servlet engine.

Run

  ant war
 
to build the web archive 'jwig-kickstart.war' or

  ant deploy
  
to build and deploy it on your servlet engine. Then start your 
servlet engine. (The servlet engine may automatically discover the 
new web application, so the last step may not be necessary.)

Now open 'http://HOST:PORT/jwig-kickstart/hello' in your browser
(with the appropriate HOST and PORT, as specified in your servlet engine 
configuration) and you will hopefully see a Hello World message. 
If not, see the servlet engine log files.

You can also run

  ant analyze
  
to run the JWIG program analyzer on your program.
