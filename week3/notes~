2) How is the requirement about deterministic content models stated in the DTD standard? How does it relate to the Unique Particle Attribution rule in XML Schema? How is the Element Declarations Consistent (EDC) rule stated in the XML Schema spec? Additionally, explain in your own words what these requirements mean. How do DTD / XML Schema validation tools behave on schemas that violate these requirements?

3) Why does XML Schema have the "unique interpretations" property and RELAX NG does not? That is, what are the features in XML Schema that imply this property? Give an example of a RELAX NG schema that doesn't have the property.

4) How can the XML Schema complex-type derivation features "restriction" and "extension" be encoded in RELAX NG? And how about the "substitution group" mechanism?

5) Give a brief description of Schematron (expected: one page excluding examples). Explain how Schematron is used in the RELAX NG schema for The Atom Syndication Format.

6) Bonus: How can validation with RELAX NG be done in linear time (as claimed in the lecture)? Hint: see Taxonomy of XML schema languages using formal language theory.
